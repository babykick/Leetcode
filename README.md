My approach to leetcode

I wrote an useful script to scrap the problem from leecode site and also the init code.

### Usage

```bash
# Install
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fetch problems
> python leecode.py hamming-distance
or
> python leecode.py https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/

The code template will be wrote into progress/<problem_name>.py 
```
