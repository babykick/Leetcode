My approach to leetcode

I wrote an useful script to scrap the problem from leecode with initial code generated.

### Usage

```bash
# Install
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fetch problems
> python leecode.py hamming-distance
or
> python leecode.py https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/
```

The code template will be wrote into progress/hamming-distance.py
